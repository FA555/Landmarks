# Landmarks

This is a project following [Apple's SwiftUI Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui) to learn SwiftUI.

The project is a simple app including a bunch of landmarks which can be displayed in a list and on a map. The user can also mark landmarks as favorites. Other features include a user profile and a settings screen.

The app is adapted to work on iOS (iPadOS), watchOS, and macOS.

Most of the code is following the tutorials, but I've added some extra features and improvements.
